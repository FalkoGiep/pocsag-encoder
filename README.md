# pocsag-encoder
Encode pocsag messages to dump to a file. This project is designed to make it
easier to understand how pocsag works, with a heavily-commented implementation.

Takes input as a series of lines, one line per message.

Message format is as follows:

    address:message

where address is an integer, and message is contents to be encoded.

Adds a random delay to the output feed of 1 to 10 seconds by default. This
is configurable in pocenc.c near the bottom of the file by the MIN\_DELAY and
MAX\_DELAY defines.

pocenc reads from stdin and writes signed 16 bit little-endian samples to stdout.


# Example Usage

    echo -e "1:hello\n2:world" | pocenc

# Compilation

pocenc doesn't rely on any dependencies but the C standard libraries. Use `make`
to compile, or run your own C compiler manually.
